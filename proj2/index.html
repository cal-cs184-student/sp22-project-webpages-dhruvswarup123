    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In the project, we dealt with 3D surfaces and meshes. We first created bezier curves and surfaces. After that, 
        we dealt with rendering meshes. The first part of this was to use phong shading by calcualting surface normals. 
        The next phase of the project was processing meshes: splits, flips and subdivisions. The one main thing I learnt
        from this was how meshes are represented, and how to approach writing mesh editing algorithms. 
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
    Casteljau's algorithm is used to recursively sample a bezier curve given some control points.
    It works by linearly interpolating each continuous pair of 'n' points by a value 't', which
    varies from 0 to 1. This results in n-1 interpolated values in between each pair considered
    before. This process is repeated for the points we just obtained, recursively, until we reach
    one point.
    <br /><br />
    For example, for a cubic bezier curve, there are 4 control points: p1, p2, p3, p4. Consider a
    "time" t = 0.5: a point in the middle of the curve. The pairs (p1, p2), (p2, p3), (p3, p4),
    are interpolated to give points p12, p23, p34. These are interpolated again as pairs
    (p12, p23), (p23, p34), to give the points p123, p234. Finally, these are interpolated again
    to give the final point 'p' on the curve. Fig 1 shows these points on an example curve.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
    The de Casteljau algorithm can be applied to create surfaces as well, by first interpolating
    all the curves in the same axis, with the same interpolation value u. And then, all
    of these obtained points are interpolated with the constant v in the other direction.

    In this case, consider a 4x5 grid of points for a bezier surface. For calculating a
    point at u, v interpolation value, we first interpolate all the 4 rows individually, and
    this gives us a set of 5 points. Then we interpolate the 5 points to give us one value.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
    The basic idea of this implementation was to first iterate through all the triangles
    around the vertex. This is done by starting at the main halfedge, and then moving to
    the "halfedge->twin()->next()" halfedge. For each triangle, I iterate thorugh each vertex,
    and calculate the cross product between two of its sides. This gives an area weighted normal.
    The normals for each triangle around the orginal vertex are summed, and then normalized.

    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>

            </tr>
            <br />
        </table>
    </div>


    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
    The edge flip operation is done by changing the pointers to all the half edges of all the
    elements in consideration, based on the flip change. It also requires that we edit the half
    edges themselves to point to the correct vertices, faces, etc. The whole operation is just
    pointer manipulation. I used the following reference image
    (<a href="https://cmu-graphics.github.io/Scotty3D/meshedit/local/edge_flip_diagram.png">source</a>)
    to perform my changes:

    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="https://cmu-graphics.github.io/Scotty3D/meshedit/local/edge_flip_diagram.png" align="middle" width="800px" />

    <br /><br />

    For the implementation, the main goal was to be able to neatly write all the structures involved,
    and then change them in another section. Following the naming convention from the image above helped a lot.
    The main problem that I faced was that multiple flips made the edge disappear. After playing around
    with the teaport mesh, and flipping edges, I realised that sometimes the edge's were getting collapsed.
    So, I went through the setneighbour function and there was one edge not being set correctly. Here
    are some images of the teapot after edge mofifications:

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
    This part was implemented in the same way as the edge flip. The only difference was the creation of new elements.
    The figure used for this part is below . The highlighted names are the new elements.

    The main debugging issue I had here was the newEdge function seemed to cause the program to crash.
    First, I read the mesh cpp and h files to understand the invocation of the functions. My calls
    seemed correct. Commenting out those functions made the program not crash. I was very confused, so
    I added some print statements. Turns out the whole function was executing. I triple checked the assignments
    and they were defintely right. I finally realised that I had not updated the edges at all. 

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>

    The main idea behind loop subdivision is to divide each triangles into 4 similar sized triangles, such
    that their vertices are updated to give a smoother mesh. The process of doing this is divided into
    3 steps:
    <br /> 1. The first is to calculate the position of each new vertex. In this step, we first calculate the
    final positions of the original vertices, based on its neighbours. Then, we do the same for the vertices
    that will  eventually be created and lie on the original edges. All these calculations are based only
    on the original mesh, and thus these are done first.
    <br /> 2. The next step is to do the triangle subdivision. This process is much easier when divided into
    2 steps. The first is to split all the original edges in any order. And the second is to flip all the new
    edges that connect an old and a new vertex. This gives us the almost evenly divided triangles.
    <br /> 3. The final step is to update the vertes value that we calculated before. This is very straightforward,
    and the only difficulty here is finding the edge that stores the new vertex position.
    <br /><br />
    In the following images, we can see that after each subdivsion of a cube, it becomes smoother each time (Explanation and solution below). Each
    edge, and corner also becomes smoother, and the hard split is gone. In the case of the cube, the mesh also
    becomes asymetric. Because each face of the cube is simply 2 triangles, it is not a symmetric division of the face.
    This is mainly why the result is asymmetric. By diving each face into 4 triangles (Fig 23), where each original edge
    corresponds to one of the new triangles, the cube can now divide symetrically (Fig 24). The images below show this effect:

    As noted before, the sharp corners and edges get smoothed out. In many cases this is undesirable, and we
    need to preserve the sharp corners. We can do some preprocessing to preserve the sharp corners. The idea
    I had was to iterate through the mesh after the subdivision, but before the assignment of the new vertex
    positions. In this loop, we would check the angle between the normals of the faces that surround the edge.
    If this is greater than a certain threshhold, then reset the vertex newpositions to position, so that doesnt change.
    And also, reset the edge isnew property to true, to prevent that from updating as well. I implemented this
    to prove that it works, and we can see the results below. Note that the angle threshold in my implementation
    has been set to 60 degrees: i.e. any face who''s normals are more than 60 degs apart, will not be split.
    The image is taken from the teapot mesh, where  the top part of the handle meets the main teapot.
    In Fig. 24/25, we can see that the normal subdivision process results in a smooth connection.
    In Fig 26/27, we can clearly see the effect that preserving edges has. The transition to the teapot's
    surface is obvious and more apparent.

    Another possible method of doing this edge preservation would be to simply split the edges and corners multiple times.
    This way, the curve produced will be much smaller, and the edges will seem sharper. In the following images, I first
    split some edges around the right edge of the cube. Then I subdivided the cube multiple times, and show that result on the right.
    We can clearly notice that the right edge is much sharper than that in Fig 22/24. 
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width=100%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/6_cube_edge_preprocess.png" align="middle" width="469px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Figure 28: Divide the right edge </figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="images/6_cube_edge_preprocess_subd.png" align="middle" width="400px" />
                    <figcaption align="middle">Figure 29: Subdivision Shows Sharp Right Edge </figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
